# Car API (car-api)
Car API is a software interface that allows developers to access and integrate data related to cars, such as make, model, year, and specifications, into their applications. This API provides a way for developers to retrieve information about cars from various sources, such as car manufacturers, dealerships, and online databases, and use that data to create custom car-related applications or services. With Car API, developers can easily incorporate car information into their software, making it easier for them to build innovative and personalized experiences for users who are interested in cars.
